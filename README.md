# Demo repository for in-depth Brunch article

This repository contains multiple Brunch-related demo projects to go along with this (French-language) [in-depth article](http://www.js-attitude.fr/2015/03/04/brunch-mon-builder-prefere/).

Every step of the way has its own project: youâ€™ll need to `npm install` in each one, and possibly `bower install` as well.
